6. **Test and validate**: Deploy configuration and test SSH aliases work as expected

## ✅ RESOLVED: Flake Updates and Compatibility Issues

### Issue Summary
Multiple compatibility issues arose when updating Homebrew-related flakes, requiring coordinated updates across the entire flake ecosystem.

### Problems Encountered
1. **Homebrew Flakes Outdated**: homebrew-bundle, homebrew-cask, homebrew-core, and nix-homebrew were significantly outdated
2. **nix-darwin Version Mismatch**: Updated nix-homebrew required newer nix-darwin, but created version incompatibility with nixpkgs
3. **Home Manager Compatibility**: Updated nixpkgs deprecated `substituteAll` function, breaking older Home Manager versions

### Solutions Implemented
1. **Updated Homebrew Flakes**: 
   - homebrew-bundle: 2025-02-06 → 2025-04-22
   - homebrew-cask: 2025-02-07 → 2025-07-23
   - homebrew-core: 2025-02-07 → 2025-07-23
   - nix-homebrew: 2025-01-05 → 2025-07-10

2. **Fixed nix-darwin Compatibility**:
   - Updated nixpkgs from 2025-03-24 → 2025-07-22
   - Updated nix-darwin to master branch for compatibility
   - Added `system.primaryUser = "ryan"` for new activation model
   - Removed deprecated options (`nix.gc.user`, `services.nix-daemon.enable`)

3. **Resolved Home Manager Issues**:
   - Updated Home Manager to version compatible with July 2025 nixpkgs
   - Fixed `substituteAll` → `replaceVars` deprecation error

### Current Status
- **✅ All Flakes Updated**: Homebrew, nix-darwin, nixpkgs, and Home Manager all on compatible versions
- **✅ Build Compatibility**: System can now build successfully with updated flake ecosystem
- **✅ Latest Packages**: Access to latest Homebrew packages and casks from July 2025

### Key Learnings
- Flake updates often require coordinated updates across multiple inputs for compatibility
- nix-darwin's new activation model requires explicit primary user configuration
- Major nixpkgs updates can break compatibility with older Home Manager versions
- Always update related flakes together when encountering version mismatch errors

## ✅ RESOLVED: Nix Build User Group GID Mismatch

### Issue Summary
After successfully updating flakes and resolving compatibility issues, encountered a new error during system activation: "Build user group has mismatching GID, aborting activation".

### Problem Encountered
- **GID Mismatch**: The default Nix build user group ID was changed from 30000 to 350
- **System State**: The system had GID 350 but nix-darwin expected 30000
- **Activation Failure**: System activation failed with error message suggesting to set `ids.gids.nixbld = 350;`
- **Deprecated Warning**: Also encountered deprecation warning for `programs.zsh.initExtraFirst`

### Solutions Implemented
1. **Fixed GID Configuration**:
   - Added `ids.gids.nixbld = 350;` to `modules/darwin/system-config.nix`
   - This tells nix-darwin to use the actual GID (350) instead of expecting the old default (30000)

2. **Updated Deprecated Zsh Option**:
   - Replaced `programs.zsh.initExtraFirst` with `programs.zsh.initContent = lib.mkBefore`
   - Updated in `modules/shared/home-manager/programs/zsh.nix`

### Current Status
- **✅ System Activation**: Successfully completed `nix run .#build-switch` without errors
- **✅ GID Configuration**: Nix build user group properly configured with correct GID
- **✅ Deprecation Warnings**: Resolved zsh deprecation warning
- **✅ Full Deployment**: System switched to new generation successfully

### Key Learnings
- GID mismatches can occur when Nix installation defaults change between versions
- Always check system activation errors for specific configuration suggestions
- Deprecation warnings should be addressed to maintain compatibility with future updates
- The `ids.gids.nixbld` option allows overriding the expected build user group ID

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Memory Bank Structure
- **Hierarchical Documentation**: Following the established memory bank pattern with core files building upon each other
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Ensuring all aspects of the Nix configuration are documented
- **Future-Proof Context**: Creating documentation that will be valuable for ongoing maintenance and development

### Documentation Approach
- **Technical Depth**: Balancing detailed technical information with high-level concepts
- **Cross-Platform Focus**: Emphasizing the multi-platform nature of the configuration
- **Practical Orientation**: Focusing on actionable information for development and maintenance

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Configuration Philosophy
- **Declarative Everything**: All system state should be declared in Nix files
- **Reproducible Builds**: Same configuration should produce identical results across machines
- **Modular Design**: Configurations should be composable and reusable
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Shared modules should work on both macOS and NixOS

### Development Workflow
- **Git-Centric**: All changes tracked in version control
- **Iterative Testing**: Build and test changes before deployment
- **Rollback Safety**: Always maintain ability to rollback to previous working state
- **Documentation First**: Document patterns and decisions as they're made

### Tool Integration
- **Consistent Theming**: Catppuccin theme across all applications
- **Keyboard-Driven**: Prefer keyboard shortcuts and CLI tools over GUI
- **Smart Navigation**: Seamless movement between terminal, editor, and system
- **Development Focus**: Optimize for software development workflows

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Nix Configuration Complexity
- **Learning Curve**: Nix has a steep learning curve but provides powerful abstractions
- **Flake Benefits**: Flakes provide better dependency management and reproducibility
- **Home Manager Value**: Essential for user-level configuration management
- **Cross-Platform Challenges**: Significant effort required to maintain compatibility

### System Architecture Benefits
- **Modularity**: Modular structure enables easy customization and maintenance
- **Reusability**: Shared modules reduce duplication across hosts
- **Flexibility**: Easy to add new hosts or modify existing configurations
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes debugging easier

### Development Environment Quality
- **Integrated Workflow**: All tools work together seamlessly
- **Consistent Experience**: Same environment across all machines
- **Powerful Tooling**: Advanced editor, terminal, and shell capabilities
- **Efficient Navigation**: Smart-splits and other tools enable rapid context switching

### Secret Management Approach
- **Security First**: All secrets encrypted and properly managed
- **Declarative Secrets**: Secret mounting declared in configuration
- **Per-Host Keys**: Each machine has unique decryption capabilities
- **Git Safety**: No secrets stored in plain text in repository

## Current Configuration State
- **Hosts**: 3 configured hosts (personal-mac, work-macbookpro, hetzner-vps)
- **Platforms**: macOS (nix-darwin) and NixOS support
- **Applications**: Comprehensive development environment with NeoVim, WezTerm, etc.
- **Themes**: Catppuccin theming across all applications
- **Secrets**: agenix-based secret management system
- **Templates**: Development environment templates for Python projects

## Outstanding Work Areas
- **Documentation**: Memory bank initialization (in progress)
- **Testing**: Verify configurations work across all hosts
- **Optimization**: Improve build times and reduce complexity where possible
- **Expansion**: Add support for additional development languages and tools

## New Requirements (Added)
1. **Host-specific Zsh Configuration**: Create a personal-mac specific zsh program with SSH aliases for common servers
2. **WezTerm SSH Pane Management**: Implement functionality to create new panes that connect to the same SSH session as the current pane
3. **SSH Session Resurrection**: Integrate SSH session restoration with WezTerm's resurrect plugin and smart_workspace_switcher
