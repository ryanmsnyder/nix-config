# Active Context: Current Work Focus

## Current Work Focus
**✅ RESOLVED: Agenix Secrets Mounting Issue** - Successfully fixed agenix secrets mounting. SSH keys are now properly decrypted and available at `~/.ssh/home-assistant-id_ed25519`.

## Recent Changes
- **Completed Memory Bank Initialization**: Successfully created all core memory bank files (projectbrief.md, productContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md, activeContext.md, progress.md)
- **Analyzed Current Configuration**: Reviewed existing SSH and Zsh configurations in shared modules
- **✅ Created Host-Specific SSH Configuration**: Added `hosts/personal-mac/home-manager/programs/ssh.nix` with server aliases
- **✅ Integrated SSH Config**: Updated `hosts/personal-mac/home-manager/default.nix` to import the SSH program
- **✅ Resolved Configuration Conflicts**: Modified SSH config to extend shared config rather than replace it
- **✅ Validated Configuration**: Successfully tested build with `nix build .#darwinConfigurations.personal-mac.system --dry-run`
- **✅ Added GitHub SSH Configuration**: Added GitHub match block with proper identity file and security settings
- **✅ Updated Home Assistant SSH**: Added identity file reference to use agenix-managed SSH key
- **✅ Fixed Agenix Module Loading**: Enabled `agenix.darwinModules.default` in flake.nix (was commented out)
- **✅ RESOLVED: Agenix Secrets Mounting**: Fixed by removing invalid `owner` option and updating secrets flake input to latest version

## Next Steps
1. **✅ COMPLETED: Fix Agenix Secrets Mounting**: Successfully resolved - secrets now properly decrypted and mounted
2. **Implement WezTerm SSH pane management**: Add functionality to create new panes connected to same SSH session
3. **Integrate SSH session resurrection**: Connect SSH sessions with WezTerm's resurrect plugin
4. **Test and validate**: Deploy configuration and test SSH aliases work as expected

## ✅ RESOLVED: Agenix Secrets Mounting Issue

### Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by two main problems:
1. **Invalid `owner` option**: The home-manager agenix module doesn't support the `owner` option (only available in system-level agenix)
2. **Outdated secrets repository**: The flake lock was pointing to an old version of the secrets repository that didn't contain the required secret file

### Solution Implemented
1. **Removed invalid `owner` option** from `hosts/personal-mac/home-manager/secrets/default.nix`
2. **Updated flake lock** with `nix flake lock --update-input secrets` to fetch latest secrets repository
3. **Created missing identity file** at `~/.ssh/agenix-id_ed25519`

### Current Status
- **✅ Secret File**: `~/.ssh/home-assistant-id_ed25519` now exists as symlink to decrypted secret
- **✅ Permissions**: Proper 600 permissions on decrypted secret file
- **✅ LaunchAgent**: `org.nix-community.home.activate-agenix` running successfully (exit code 0)
- **✅ Decryption**: Secret properly decrypted and available for SSH usage

### Key Learnings
- Home-manager agenix module has different options than system-level agenix module
- Flake inputs need to be updated when secrets repository changes
- macOS agenix uses LaunchAgents for secret mounting, not systemd services

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Memory Bank Structure
- **Hierarchical Documentation**: Following the established memory bank pattern with core files building upon each other
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Ensuring all aspects of the Nix configuration are documented
- **Future-Proof Context**: Creating documentation that will be valuable for ongoing maintenance and development

### Documentation Approach
- **Technical Depth**: Balancing detailed technical information with high-level concepts
- **Cross-Platform Focus**: Emphasizing the multi-platform nature of the configuration
- **Practical Orientation**: Focusing on actionable information for development and maintenance

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Configuration Philosophy
- **Declarative Everything**: All system state should be declared in Nix files
- **Reproducible Builds**: Same configuration should produce identical results across machines
- **Modular Design**: Configurations should be composable and reusable
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Shared modules should work on both macOS and NixOS

### Development Workflow
- **Git-Centric**: All changes tracked in version control
- **Iterative Testing**: Build and test changes before deployment
- **Rollback Safety**: Always maintain ability to rollback to previous working state
- **Documentation First**: Document patterns and decisions as they're made

### Tool Integration
- **Consistent Theming**: Catppuccin theme across all applications
- **Keyboard-Driven**: Prefer keyboard shortcuts and CLI tools over GUI
- **Smart Navigation**: Seamless movement between terminal, editor, and system
- **Development Focus**: Optimize for software development workflows

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Nix Configuration Complexity
- **Learning Curve**: Nix has a steep learning curve but provides powerful abstractions
- **Flake Benefits**: Flakes provide better dependency management and reproducibility
- **Home Manager Value**: Essential for user-level configuration management
- **Cross-Platform Challenges**: Significant effort required to maintain compatibility

### System Architecture Benefits
- **Modularity**: Modular structure enables easy customization and maintenance
- **Reusability**: Shared modules reduce duplication across hosts
- **Flexibility**: Easy to add new hosts or modify existing configurations
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes debugging easier

### Development Environment Quality
- **Integrated Workflow**: All tools work together seamlessly
- **Consistent Experience**: Same environment across all machines
- **Powerful Tooling**: Advanced editor, terminal, and shell capabilities
- **Efficient Navigation**: Smart-splits and other tools enable rapid context switching

### Secret Management Approach
- **Security First**: All secrets encrypted and properly managed
- **Declarative Secrets**: Secret mounting declared in configuration
- **Per-Host Keys**: Each machine has unique decryption capabilities
- **Git Safety**: No secrets stored in plain text in repository

## Current Configuration State
- **Hosts**: 3 configured hosts (personal-mac, work-macbookpro, hetzner-vps)
- **Platforms**: macOS (nix-darwin) and NixOS support
- **Applications**: Comprehensive development environment with NeoVim, WezTerm, etc.
- **Themes**: Catppuccin theming across all applications
- **Secrets**: agenix-based secret management system
- **Templates**: Development environment templates for Python projects

## Outstanding Work Areas
- **Documentation**: Memory bank initialization (in progress)
- **Testing**: Verify configurations work across all hosts
- **Optimization**: Improve build times and reduce complexity where possible
- **Expansion**: Add support for additional development languages and tools

## New Requirements (Added)
1. **Host-specific Zsh Configuration**: Create a personal-mac specific zsh program with SSH aliases for common servers
2. **WezTerm SSH Pane Management**: Implement functionality to create new panes that connect to the same SSH session as the current pane
3. **SSH Session Resurrection**: Integrate SSH session restoration with WezTerm's resurrect plugin and smart_workspace_switcher
