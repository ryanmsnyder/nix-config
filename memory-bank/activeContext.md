# Active Context: Current Work Focus

## Current Work Focus
**Memory Bank Initialization**: Setting up comprehensive documentation system for the Nix configuration repository to enable effective context preservation across sessions.

## Recent Changes
- **Created projectbrief.md**: Established foundational project overview and scope
- **Created productContext.md**: Documented the "why" behind the configuration system
- **Created systemPatterns.md**: Detailed system architecture and design patterns
- **Created techContext.md**: Comprehensive technical stack and tool documentation

## Next Steps
1. **Create activeContext.md**: Document current work state and recent activities (this file)
2. **Create progress.md**: Track what's working, what needs building, and current status
3. **Review and validate**: Ensure all memory bank files are complete and accurate
4. **Test memory bank**: Verify the documentation provides sufficient context for future work

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Memory Bank Structure
- **Hierarchical Documentation**: Following the established memory bank pattern with core files building upon each other
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Ensuring all aspects of the Nix configuration are documented
- **Future-Proof Context**: Creating documentation that will be valuable for ongoing maintenance and development

### Documentation Approach
- **Technical Depth**: Balancing detailed technical information with high-level concepts
- **Cross-Platform Focus**: Emphasizing the multi-platform nature of the configuration
- **Practical Orientation**: Focusing on actionable information for development and maintenance

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Configuration Philosophy
- **Declarative Everything**: All system state should be declared in Nix files
- **Reproducible Builds**: Same configuration should produce identical results across machines
- **Modular Design**: Configurations should be composable and reusable
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Shared modules should work on both macOS and NixOS

### Development Workflow
- **Git-Centric**: All changes tracked in version control
- **Iterative Testing**: Build and test changes before deployment
- **Rollback Safety**: Always maintain ability to rollback to previous working state
- **Documentation First**: Document patterns and decisions as they're made

### Tool Integration
- **Consistent Theming**: Catppuccin theme across all applications
- **Keyboard-Driven**: Prefer keyboard shortcuts and CLI tools over GUI
- **Smart Navigation**: Seamless movement between terminal, editor, and system
- **Development Focus**: Optimize for software development workflows

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Nix Configuration Complexity
- **Learning Curve**: Nix has a steep learning curve but provides powerful abstractions
- **Flake Benefits**: Flakes provide better dependency management and reproducibility
- **Home Manager Value**: Essential for user-level configuration management
- **Cross-Platform Challenges**: Significant effort required to maintain compatibility

### System Architecture Benefits
- **Modularity**: Modular structure enables easy customization and maintenance
- **Reusability**: Shared modules reduce duplication across hosts
- **Flexibility**: Easy to add new hosts or modify existing configurations
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes debugging easier

### Development Environment Quality
- **Integrated Workflow**: All tools work together seamlessly
- **Consistent Experience**: Same environment across all machines
- **Powerful Tooling**: Advanced editor, terminal, and shell capabilities
- **Efficient Navigation**: Smart-splits and other tools enable rapid context switching

### Secret Management Approach
- **Security First**: All secrets encrypted and properly managed
- **Declarative Secrets**: Secret mounting declared in configuration
- **Per-Host Keys**: Each machine has unique decryption capabilities
- **Git Safety**: No secrets stored in plain text in repository

## Current Configuration State
- **Hosts**: 3 configured hosts (personal-mac, work-macbookpro, hetzner-vps)
- **Platforms**: macOS (nix-darwin) and NixOS support
- **Applications**: Comprehensive development environment with NeoVim, WezTerm, etc.
- **Themes**: Catppuccin theming across all applications
- **Secrets**: agenix-based secret management system
- **Templates**: Development environment templates for Python projects

## Outstanding Work Areas
- **Documentation**: Memory bank initialization (in progress)
- **Testing**: Verify configurations work across all hosts
- **Optimization**: Improve build times and reduce complexity where possible
- **Expansion**: Add support for additional development languages and tools
