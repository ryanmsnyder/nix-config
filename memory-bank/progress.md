# Progress: Current Status and Development State

## What's Working

### Core Infrastructure
- **Nix Flakes Configuration**: Fully functional flake-based system with proper dependency management
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Successfully supports both macOS (nix-darwin) and NixOS environments
- **Home Manager Integration**: User-level configuration management working across all hosts
- **Secret Management**: agenix-based encrypted secrets system operational

### Host Configurations
- **personal-mac**: Fully configured M1 MacBook Pro with complete development environment
- **work-macbookpro**: Work laptop configuration with VPN scripts and work-specific tools
- **hetzner-vps**: NixOS server configuration for cloud deployment

### Development Environment
- **NeoVim**: Advanced editor with LSP, DAP, and comprehensive plugin ecosystem
- **WezTerm**: Terminal with workspace management, resurrect plugin, and smart navigation
- **Shell Environment**: Zsh with autosuggestions, syntax highlighting, and custom aliases
- **File Management**: lf file manager with custom scripts and integrations
- **Git Integration**: Comprehensive git configuration with gitsigns and telescope integration

### Application Ecosystem
- **Theming**: Consistent Catppuccin theming across all applications
- **Package Management**: Declarative package installation via Nix
- **Homebrew Integration**: nix-homebrew for Mac App Store and cask applications
- **Font Management**: Berkeley Mono font properly packaged and distributed

### Build System
- **Automated Builds**: Scripts for building and switching configurations
- **Platform Detection**: Automatic host detection and configuration selection
- **Template System**: Development environment templates for Python projects
- **Overlay System**: Custom package overlays for macOS applications

## What's Left to Build

### New Requirements (Priority)
1. **Host-specific Zsh Configuration**: 
   - Create personal-mac specific zsh program with SSH server aliases
   - Integrate with existing shared zsh configuration
   - Maintain modularity and reusability

2. **WezTerm SSH Pane Management**:
   - Implement functionality to create new panes connected to same SSH session
   - Research WezTerm's SSH domain capabilities
   - Integrate with existing pane navigation system

3. **SSH Session Resurrection**:
   - Extend resurrect plugin to handle SSH sessions
   - Integrate with smart_workspace_switcher for SSH workspaces
   - Ensure session state preservation across restarts

### Ongoing Improvements
- **Documentation**: Complete memory bank system (in progress)
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing across all host configurations
- **Performance**: Optimize build times and reduce configuration complexity
- **Expansion**: Additional language support and development tools

### Future Enhancements
- **NixOS Desktop**: Complete desktop environment configuration
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated testing and deployment pipelines
- **Backup Strategy**: Configuration backup and restoration procedures
- **Monitoring**: System health and configuration drift detection

## Current Status

### Recently Completed
- **Memory Bank Initialization**: Comprehensive documentation system established
- **Project Documentation**: All core memory bank files created and populated
- **Configuration Analysis**: Thorough review of existing system architecture

### In Progress
- **Memory Bank Finalization**: Completing progress.md documentation
- **Requirement Analysis**: Planning implementation of new SSH and WezTerm features

### Next Immediate Steps
1. **Create personal-mac zsh configuration**: Host-specific shell aliases for SSH servers
2. **Research WezTerm SSH domains**: Investigate technical approach for SSH pane management
3. **Design SSH resurrection**: Plan integration with existing resurrect plugin

## Known Issues

### Critical Issues
- **ðŸš¨ Agenix Secrets Not Mounting**: Encrypted SSH keys are not being decrypted and mounted during home-manager activation on macOS
  - **Impact**: SSH configuration references non-existent key files, preventing connections
  - **Status**: Under investigation - modules are loaded but activation not occurring
  - **Suspected Cause**: macOS-specific agenix configuration requirements or missing system-level dependencies

### Current Limitations
- **SSH Session Management**: No automated SSH session restoration in WezTerm
- **Host-specific Shell Config**: All zsh configuration currently shared across hosts
- **SSH Pane Creation**: No mechanism to create new panes in existing SSH sessions

### Technical Debt
- **Configuration Complexity**: Some areas could benefit from simplification
- **Documentation Gaps**: Some technical decisions lack comprehensive documentation
- **Testing Coverage**: Limited automated testing of configuration changes

### Platform-Specific Issues
- **macOS Permissions**: Some applications require manual permission grants
- **NixOS Testing**: Limited testing environment for NixOS configurations
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Ongoing effort to maintain compatibility
- **Agenix macOS Integration**: Secrets management requires additional investigation on Darwin systems

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Architecture Evolution
- **Started**: Simple single-host configuration
- **Evolved**: Multi-host, cross-platform system with shared modules
- **Current**: Sophisticated modular system with host-specific customizations
- **Future**: Enhanced SSH management and workspace resurrection

### Technology Choices
- **Nix Flakes**: Chosen for reproducibility and dependency management
- **Home Manager**: Selected for user-level configuration management
- **agenix**: Adopted for secure secret management
- **Catppuccin**: Standardized on for consistent theming

### Development Workflow
- **Initial**: Manual configuration management
- **Current**: Declarative, version-controlled system
- **Target**: Fully automated with comprehensive testing and documentation

## Success Metrics

### Achieved Goals
- **Reproducibility**: Same configuration produces identical results across machines
- **Maintainability**: Easy to modify and extend configurations
- **Cross-Platform**: Successfully works on both macOS and NixOS
- **Developer Experience**: Comprehensive, integrated development environment

### Ongoing Objectives
- **SSH Workflow Enhancement**: Streamlined SSH session management
- **Documentation Completeness**: Comprehensive context preservation
- **Performance Optimization**: Fast build and switch times
- **Feature Completeness**: All desired functionality implemented and working
